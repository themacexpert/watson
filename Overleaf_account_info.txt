Overleaf is an online LaTeX editor that allows you to create LaTeX
documents without installing a program on your computer. It's also
a good way for the three of us to collaborate on the same document.

I have created a shared Overleaf account for our group. Here are 
the credentials:

account name: KMEcs89group

Let me know if you have any questions about how to use LaTeX.
