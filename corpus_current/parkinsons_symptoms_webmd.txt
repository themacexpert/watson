What Are the Symptoms of Parkinson's Disease?
Parkinson's disease is a movement disorder that progresses slowly. Some people will first notice a sense of weakness, difficulty walking, and stiff muscles. Others may notice a tremor of the head or hands. Parkinson's is a progressive disorder and the symptoms gradually worsen. The general symptoms of Parkinson's disease include:

Slowness of voluntary movements, especially in the initiation of such movements as walking or rolling over in bed
Decreased facial expression, monotonous speech, and decreased eye blinking
A shuffling gait with poor arm swing and stooped posture
Unsteady balance; difficulty rising from a sitting position
Continuous "pill-rolling" motion of the thumb and forefinger
Abnormal tone or stiffness in the trunk and extremities
Swallowing problems in later stages
Lightheadedness or fainting when standing (orthostatic hypotension)
